git checkout your-branch

# Use interactive rebase to remove the unwanted commits. 
# Start an interactive rebase from a commit before the ones you want to remove. For example, if you want to remove the last three commits:
git rebase -i HEAD~4

# Change pick to drop for the commits you want to remove, switch to edit mode by pressing I: 
pick <commit-hash1> Commit message 1
drop <commit-hash2> Commit message 2

#Press Esc and then save the file by typing :wq and the interactive rebase will be applied

# Since you have rewritten the commit history, you need to force push the changes to the remote branch. 
# This is a potentially destructive operation, so use it with caution.
git push origin your-branch --force
